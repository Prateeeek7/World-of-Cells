      "introduction": "This timeline details the discovery of over 100 human cell types. It highlights the key figures and approximate years when cells were first observed, described, and correctly identified. The invention and refinement of the microscope (1590-1670s) began the process, the 19th century was the golden age of histological discovery with improved microscopes and staining, and the electron microscope (1930s) revealed ultrastructural details.",
