Beyond their defensive roles, keratinocytes participate in sensory signal transduction and wound healing by releasing signaling molecules that influence the activity of fibroblasts, immune cells, and neighboring keratinocytes.

They can differentiate from resident fibroblasts, pericytes, or dedifferentiated smooth muscle cells. In several organs, they also originate via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and in some cases circulating fibrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells contribute to their pool. This diversity of origins explains their presence in multiple tissues during repair and fibrosis.","discovery":{"scientist":"Giorgio Gabbiani and colleagues first described myofibroblasts in granulation tissue.","year":"1971","stain":"Initially identified by electron microscopy as fibroblast-like cells with contractile microfilament bundles and dense bodies, they were later characterized immunohistochemically with \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), vimentin, ED-A fibronectin, calponin, and sometimes desmin. They are negative for late smooth muscle markers like smoothelin and h-caldesmon, distinguishing them from mature smooth muscle cells."},"location":"Myofibroblasts are transiently located in granulation tissue during wound healing, where they populate the connective tissue matrix. They persist in pathological fibrotic lesions such as pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, renal interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac fibrosis. They also appear in tumour stroma, the perivascular interstitium, and subepithelial connective tissue layers, particularly in the gut and respiratory tract. During development, they can be found around bile ducts, vessels, and organ scaffolds where they stabilize emerging structures.","function":"Myofibroblasts serve as hybrid cells with features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Their primary function is to contract and generate mechanical force to close wounds, mediated by actin\u2013myosin stress fibres anchored to the extracellular matrix via integrins and fibronexus junctions. They secrete and remodel extracellular matrix components, producing high levels of collagens (types I and III), fibronectin, and proteoglycans, while also releasing metalloproteinases and their inhibitors to restructure tissue. In addition, they regulate the inflammatory milieu by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors such as TGF-\u03b2, PDGF, and CTGF, which modulate immune and parenchymal cells. Myofibroblasts are highly mechanosensitive, responding to matrix stiffness and strain, which drives their activation. While transient activation is essential for wound closure, persistent myofibroblasts contribute to pathological fibrosis and tumour progression by stiffening the extracellular matrix and promoting angiogenesis and invasion.","life_span":"Under normal physiological wound healing, myofibroblasts are transient. They expand during the proliferative phase, carry out contraction and matrix deposition, and then undergo apoptosis or deactivate once repair is completed. However, in chronic injury or fibrotic disease they evade apoptosis, persist long-term, and maintain a profibrotic, contractile phenotype that drives organ dysfunction. Some studies also show that they can partially revert to a more fibroblast-like phenotype under certain conditions.","adherent":"Myofibroblasts are strongly adherent to their extracellular environment. They form integrin-based focal adhesions and specialized fibronexus structures that connect intracellular actin bundles to extracellular fibronectin fibrils. This adhesion allows them to exert traction on the matrix and contract wounds. They also form intercellular junctions such as adherens junctions and gap junctions, enabling coordinated contraction and communication with neighbouring cells.","effect_of_ageing":"With ageing, myofibroblasts adopt a more persistent and profibrotic phenotype. Age-related extracellular matrix stiffening enhances their activation, and they become less capable of undergoing apoptosis after injury resolution. Senescence-associated secretory phenotypes amplify local inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. These changes make aged tissues more prone to fibrotic diseases, chronic scarring, and impaired regenerative capacity.","related_disease":"Persistent myofibroblast activity is central to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. They drive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease-associated fibrosis, and cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction or hypertensive stress. In dermatology, they contribute to hypertrophic scars, keloids, and systemic sclerosis. In oncology, tumour-associated myofibroblasts stiffen the stroma, facilitate angiogenesis, and promote tumour invasion and metastasis.","history_of_evolution":"The myofibroblast phenotype likely evolved as a specialized adaptation for efficient wound healing in vertebrates. Fibroblast-like ECM-secreting cells exist in invertebrates, but the acquisition of contractile properties mediated by \u03b1-SMA and integrin-based adhesions allowed vertebrate tissues to achieve rapid wound closure under mechanical stress. This phenotypic plasticity \u2014 the ability of fibroblasts to switch into a contractile state \u2014 represents an evolutionary trade-off: it is advantageous in acute repair but deleterious in chronic injury or fibrosis.","relevance_to_tissue_development":"During embryogenesis, myofibroblast-like cells appear transiently to shape organ structures through mechanical force generation and matrix deposition. In the liver, portal tract myofibroblasts support bile duct development; in lung and kidney development, they guide branching morphogenesis by stabilizing nascent structures. Their ability to generate contractile tension and secrete provisional extracellular matrix is critical for shaping organ architecture, although most regress or are replaced by other stromal cell types after maturation.","tissue_engineering_research":"In regenerative medicine, myofibroblasts are studied both as a target and as a model system. Research focuses on preventing their persistent activation in engineered tissues by designing scaffolds with controlled stiffness and biochemical cues that discourage fibrosis. Therapeutic approaches aim to inhibit key pathways such as TGF-\u03b2 and YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction to limit pathological activation. In vitro, myofibroblast cultures are used to model fibrotic diseases of lung, liver, and kidney, providing platforms for drug screening.

Their fate depends on local signaling pathways including Notch, Wnt, FGF, BMP, and Hedgehog. For example, high Notch activity drives ductal fate, while reduced Notch activity allows endocrine differentiation. \\n\\n**Physiological Role:** PPCs are critical for pancreatic organogenesis and establishment of functional islets. They generate a balanced population of exocrine and endocrine cells to support digestion and glucose homeostasis. In adults, most PPCs are quiescent, but duct-associated progenitor-like cells may contribute to limited regeneration after injury. \\n\\n**Pathological Role:** In diabetes mellitus, the inability of \u03b2-cells to regenerate is a key problem. PPCs represent a latent regenerative reservoir that could, in theory, replace lost \u03b2-cells. However, in chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), aberrant activation of progenitor pathways contributes to pathological ductular proliferation and malignant transformation. Dysregulation of progenitor-related genes like PDX1 and SOX9 is linked to tumor initiation. \\n\\n**Clinical Significance:** PPCs are central to regenerative medicine strategies. Stem cell differentiation protocols aim to mimic embryonic PPC stages to generate transplantable \u03b2-cells for diabetes therapy. Understanding PPC biology also helps in disease modeling, drug screening, and designing targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer.
